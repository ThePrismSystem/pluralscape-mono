# ADR-023 — packages/types as single source of truth for domain entity shapes

## Status

Accepted (refreshed 2026-04-22). This ADR refines the original Zod-type-alignment decision by extending it into a full single-source-of-truth convention covering Drizzle schema and generated OpenAPI types alongside Zod.

## Context

The 2026-04-20 comprehensive audit flagged "branded-type drift at API/DB boundaries" as a recurring pattern. Root cause: four plausible sources for the same domain shape — `packages/types`, Drizzle schema in `packages/db`, Zod schemas in `packages/validation`, and generated `api-types.ts` in `packages/api-client`. Each layer can drift independently.

Drizzle cannot be the source of truth: the server only sees metadata columns plus an opaque `encryptedData` blob. It has no knowledge of the encrypted field names or their types. The types package is the only layer that holds the full decrypted domain shape.

## Decision

Every encrypted domain entity publishes a six-link canonical chain from `packages/types`:

1. **`<Entity>`** — full decrypted domain shape. Branded IDs, `Date` objects, all decrypted fields. No DB-internal columns.
2. **`<Entity>EncryptedFields`** — keys-union of fields encrypted client-side. Either a literal union or `Exclude<keyof <Entity>, allowlist>` when the policy is "encrypt every field except an allowlist".
3. **`<Entity>EncryptedInput`** — `Pick<<Entity>, <Entity>EncryptedFields>`. The shape callers encrypt and submit to `encryptedData`. Use a defensively distributive form (`<Entity> extends unknown ? Pick<…> : never`) when `<Entity>` is a discriminated union.
4. **`<Entity>ServerMetadata`** — raw Drizzle row. Branded IDs, `Date`, `encryptedData: EncryptedBlob` (or `| null`), plus DB-internal columns (search_tsv, partition keys, computed columns) and `ServerInternal<…>`-marked server-fill-only fields.
5. **`<Entity>Result`** — `EncryptedWire<<Entity>ServerMetadata>`. Server JS-runtime response shape: `encryptedData` brand-tagged as `EncryptedBase64`, `ServerInternal<…>` fields stripped.
6. **`<Entity>Wire`** — `Serialize<<Entity>Result>`. JSON-serialized HTTP shape: brands strip to plain `string`, `UnixMillis` becomes `number`, `EncryptedBase64` collapses to `string`.

Plaintext entities publish only `<Entity>` → `<Entity>ServerMetadata` → `<Entity>Wire`.

The `EncryptedWire<T>` helper (`packages/types/src/encrypted-wire.ts`) and `Serialize<T>` together produce links 5 and 6 mechanically; only the keys-union and the server metadata require hand-authoring per entity. Per-entity service `<X>Result` types are derivations: `type <X>Result = EncryptedWire<<X>ServerMetadata>`. Hand-rolled `<X>Result` interfaces are reserved for cases where the wire shape genuinely diverges from the metadata (denormalized server-internal fields that must not leak, polymorphic refs the wire widens to plain string, validated narrowings of `Record<string, unknown>` payloads, etc.); each retained hand-roll documents _why_ in a comment above the interface.

Downstream layers derive-or-assert-equal rather than redefine:

### Brand shape canonicalization

Pluralscape's canonical brand is symbol-keyed: `type Brand<T, B> = T & { readonly [__brand]: B }` where `__brand` is a module-internal `unique symbol` in `packages/types/src/ids.ts`. Literal-keyed forms (`{ readonly __brand: "Name" }`) are drift and must be migrated to `Brand<T, B>`. The `__brand` symbol is module-internal (marked `@internal` in JSDoc) — consumers should not import it. Construction of branded IDs goes through `brandId()` and `assertBrandedTargetId()`.

Sibling module-internal symbols follow the same pattern: `__encBase64` (in `encryption-primitives.ts`) brands wire-form base64 ciphertext, and `__serverInternal` (in `server-internal.ts`) marks server-fill-only fields. Both are `@internal` and exported only so co-located type-level helpers (`UnbrandedEquivalence<T>` and the `Serialize<T>` / `EncryptedWire<T>` strip rules) can structurally match the marker.

### `ServerInternal<T>` convention

`ServerInternal<T>` (defined in `packages/types/src/server-internal.ts`) marks
fields on `*ServerMetadata` types that are server-fill-only and must not leak
onto the wire. `EncryptedWire<T>` strips all top-level `ServerInternal<…>`-
marked fields automatically, and `Serialize<T>` strips those same fields
recursively at every nesting level so OpenAPI ↔ wire parity assertions remain
coherent.

Reference case: `FrontingComment.sessionStartTime` is denormalized from the
parent fronting session for the partition-FK in the partitioned
`fronting_sessions` table (ADR-019). It is server-internal and must never
appear in client-visible JSON.

### `EncryptedBase64` brand

`EncryptedBase64` (defined in `packages/types/src/encryption-primitives.ts`)
is a phantom brand on `string` for ciphertext on the wire. `EncryptedWire<T>`
threads the brand through `encryptedData` so the type system distinguishes
wire-form ciphertext from arbitrary strings (e.g. IDs). The brand is
constructed exclusively at the encoder boundary (`encryptedBlobToBase64` /
`encryptedBlobToBase64OrNull` in `apps/api/src/lib/encrypted-blob.ts`).

The OpenAPI generator emits raw `string` for `encryptedData` fields. The
parity bridge is `UnbrandedEquivalence<T>` (in `type-assertions.ts`) plus
the documented one-way subtype relation `EncryptedBase64 extends string`,
asserted explicitly in `scripts/openapi-wire-parity.type-test.ts`. This
preserves the canonical "brands on domain, not wire" model from the core
ADR while letting the wire envelope keep the brand internally.

### Optional-vs-`| undefined` semantics

`packages/types` uses `?:` (key may be missing) for optional fields. Zod's `.optional()` infers `T | undefined` (key present, value undefined).

**Pilot decision (2026-04-22):** Option B — normalize `packages/types` input-body optional fields to `T | undefined`. The Member pilot (`packages/validation/src/__tests__/type-parity/member.type.test.ts`) surfaced **0 optional-vs-undefined mismatches** across `CreateMemberBody` / `UpdateMemberBody` / `DuplicateMemberBody`, because those bodies happen to contain only required fields. Zero is well below the `≥ 10` threshold at which a helper would pay off, so the fleet convention is: when a future input-body type introduces an optional field that pairs with a `.optional()` Zod schema, declare it as `readonly field: T | undefined` (not `readonly field?: T`) so `Equal<z.infer<...>, Body>` remains green. Full-entity types (`<Entity>`) keep `?:` optional markers — only input-body types on the API boundary convergence to Zod's inference shape. `Equal` remains the default parity helper; no `OptionalEqual` sibling is introduced.

### Transform consumer convention — `packages/data/src/transforms/`

Every per-entity client-side transform module owns **functions only**. Local
domain/wire/encrypted-input/raw-row aliases are forbidden — the transform
imports `<Entity>`, `<Entity>EncryptedInput`, `<Entity>Wire`, and `Archived<<Entity>>`
directly from `@pluralscape/types`. Runtime validation of decrypted blobs is
delegated to `<Entity>EncryptedInputSchema.parse(decrypted)` from
`@pluralscape/validation`; hand-rolled `assertX*` validators are removed.

When the API serializer omits fields the canonical wire requires (e.g. tRPC
`listVotes` does not surface `systemId`/`version`/`updatedAt` for `PollVote`),
the transform owns a narrow `<Entity>ServerWire = Omit<<Entity>Wire, …>` shim
local to the transform file — never an `as unknown as <Entity>Wire` cast.
This keeps the ServerWire deviation explicit at the boundary and visible to
reviewers.

The Member-pilot transform (`packages/data/src/transforms/member.ts`) is the
canonical reference shape for new transforms.

### Enforcement — `pnpm types:check-sot`

A single root script (`scripts/check-types-sot.ts`) runs all three parity mechanisms sequentially, short-circuiting on first failure. CI step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` blocks on failure. Drift at any layer fails CI.

## Consequences

- Field additions/renames must start in `packages/types`, not in Drizzle or Zod.
- Encrypted-field schema decisions (`T1` encrypted vs `T3` plaintext per field) remain judgment calls, not mechanically derived.
- Full codegen from types → Drizzle/Zod is explicitly rejected (non-goal).
