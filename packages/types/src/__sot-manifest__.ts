/**
 * Registry of every domain entity that participates in the types-as-SoT
 * parity gates. Each entry carries the canonical triple:
 *
 * - `domain` — the full decrypted domain shape (`<Entity>`)
 * - `server` — the server-visible Drizzle row shape (`<Entity>ServerMetadata`)
 * - `wire`   — the JSON-serialized HTTP shape (`<Entity>Wire`)
 *
 * Completeness checks in `packages/db` and `packages/validation` assert that
 * every Drizzle table and every Zod schema maps to a manifest entry, so
 * silently dropping an entity during fleet work fails CI.
 *
 * Phase 0: manifest is empty. Pilot (Phase 1) registers Member and
 * AuditLogEntry. Fleet (Phase 2) fills the rest.
